How Not to Travel The World is about following your dreams, no matter how many curveballs life throws at you. It is about learning to get out of your comfort zone, finding the humour in messed up situations, and falling in love with life on the road. After a decade of teaching elementary school, and constantly dreaming about my next travel adventure, I decided to step back and follow my explorer’s heart, becoming a travel photographer and writer. I have loved travel for as long as I can remember. My parents instilled that in me at a very young age. Our summers, and a lot of our weekends, were spent travelling in our RV. We did a lot of local trips here in ALBERTA but also went on some long haul journeys. We drove to ALASKA, across Canada, and to Southern California, just to name a few. I loved seeing new places and learning about the history and culture. Social Studies was always my favourite subject in school. Since that first trip, I have had wanderlust. I’ve travelled to many different places in many different ways- independent trips, group tours, package vacations and cruises. While there are pros and cons to each type of travel, I definitely have discovered my travel preferences. I make it a priority to travel. It not only makes me happy in the short term, but I find it to be extremely fulfilling on a deeper level. I try to take one big trip a year and a few smaller ones scattered throughout. I would love to travel full time, like I’ve seen so many other people do, but for now this is what works for me.",
